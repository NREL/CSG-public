# Frequently Asked Questions about the CSG Model

#### What is the CAV Scenario Generation model?
The ``Connected and Automated Vehicles Scenario Generation (CSG) model`` is a system dynamics model built to simulate future scenarios with high levels of connected and automated vehicle use. The publicly released version of the ``CSG`` is called ``CSG-public``.

#### How is the CSG-public licensed? 
The ``CSG-public`` is released under [this BSD license](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public/BSD-License-CAV-Scenario-Generation.pdf). Please see the [Readme file](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public/Readme-CSG-Public-Release.md) for details on licensing and attribution.

#### What do I need to run the CSG-public? 
The ``CSG-public`` model is developed in [STELLA software](https://www.iseesystems.com/).

#### Where can I download the CSG-public? 
Download the [CSG-public GitHub repository](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public). The “Models” folder contains the model file, ``CSG-public.STMX``, and supporting files.

#### How can I change the inputs? 
You can directly change inputs in the model. Alternatively, you can copy the input sheet, modify it, import it, run the model, and view the results. This provides a clear record of your input changes.

#### How can I find the references for model assumptions? 
The [Sources.xlsx file](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public/Sources.xlsx) from the ``CSG-public`` GitHub repository contains sources for key model assumptions, which also appear in the documentation fields within the model. 

#### How can I learn more about the CSG-public? 
Please review the user guidance and other files in the “Documentation” folder from the GitHub repository.
