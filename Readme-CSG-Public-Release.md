# New Users of the CSG Model, Please Read!

## Development

#### Project Team (alphabetical order):
Brian Bush, Jeff Gonder, Laura Vimmerstedt ([National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://www.nrel.gov/) [NREL])

#### Special Thanks 
U.S. Department of Energy - Vehicle Technologies Office, especially Erin Boyd. 

Lauren Sittler, NREL.

#### Project Location and Funding
This model is formally named ``Connected and Automated Vehicles Scenario Generation Model`` abbreviated ``CSG``. The public version of the model (``CSG-public``) is distinct from the internal NREL version (``CSG``). This model was developed by NREL, which is operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08-GO28308 and funded by DOE's [Vehicle Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/science-innovation/vehicles). The model was built in Golden, Colorado within NREL's [Strategic Energy Analysis Center](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/).

## Licensing and Attribution

The ``CSG-public`` is released under [this BSD license](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public).

If you are using the ``CSG-public`` outside of the NREL Connected and Automated Vehicle project, clearly distinguish your results (e.g., CSG-X, where X indicates your name or institution).

Non-NREL users of the ``CSG-public`` should not attribute their results to the ``CSG-public``. This is the case even if the model has not been changed. Attribution of non-NREL results to the ``CSG-public`` without modifying the name implies endorsement and is not allowed by the license.

#### Example Citation
"CSG-X was developed from the public version of the CAV Scenario Generation Model, CSG-public (NREL 2019)."

## User Guidance

#### GitHub
For directions on using GitHub, please see [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en#dotcom).

#### Software and Capabilities
The model is saved in [STELLA Professional](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-professional.aspx) 1.9.1. We recommend using that version or later. See [ISEE Systems](https://www.iseesystems.com/) for documentation and training related to the STELLA software.

#### Interacting with the CSG Development Team 
We welcome discussions of potential collaborations, and we are happy to make connections to develop cooperative analyses.

For support on calibrating the model to a new dataset, please contact <brian.bush@nrel.gov>.

#### Models and Data
Located within [this folder](https://github.com/NREL/CSG-public/Models) is the current public version of the ``CSG-public`` and a default input sheet. This input sheet will restore all default values to the model. It can be copied and modified to record other desired inputs. For information about using input sheets, please see STELLA documentation.
